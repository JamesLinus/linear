# Linear

Linear is a ruler application for Mac, made with web-development in mind.
It seats in your tray-bar and doesn't get in your way. Here is what it does:

* It's not a browser extension. Browser extensions are really useful, but fail
short when inspecting the DOM of a document, since they often inject overlay
elements themselves.
* Use PX or EM, set the default font-size to your convenience.
* Create multiple rulers
* Duplicate a ruler, conserving its height and with. Really useful when checking
margins.
* It adapts to dark and light backgrounds
* System-wide shortcuts to hide/show rulers
